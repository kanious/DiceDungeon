1. How to build the project

- â˜… Move to the PlugIns/include folder and decompress "boost_1_59_0.zip" file to the "boost_1_59_0" folder. The path should be like "PlugIns/include/boost_1_59_0/boost/...".

- Please set "DiceDungeonClient" project as a starter project and build with x64 configuration / Debug mode. Or you can execute with "DiceDungeonClient.exe" file in x64\Debug folder.
* Release mode is not working because of the library file of Thrift (libthrift.lib).
  Keep researching to fix this problem...

- Execute "x64\Debug\LeaderboardServer.exe" first before run the client project. If you ran the client project first, use "Connect" button in the right side of UI after executing server project.

3. Description

1) Persistence
All related code are in 
	PumpkinEngine > 05.IndependantFunctions > DAO filter
	DiceDungeonClient > 98.Manager > ScoreManager class
- DiceDungeonClient is using "score.db" file in x64/Assets folder.
- LeaderboardServer is using "ranking.db" file in x64/Assets folder.


2) Networking
All related code are in 
	LeaderboardServer Project
	DiceDungeonClient > 05.Leaderboard filter (All files compiled with Thrift)
	DiceDungeonClient > 98.Manager > LeaderboardManager class
- Thrift file is in x64/Assets folder.


3) Audio & Scripting
All related code are in 
	PumpkinEngine > 05.IndependantFunctions > LuaBrain Filter
I'm using this script the most in here:
	DiceDungeonClient > 03.Animator > Animator class
- Lua script file is in x64/Assets folder.
- I'm playing a sound effect like footstep to a specific keyframe in the player's animation (Pressing Key "F1 ~ F8").
- And play the background music also (Press key "P").
