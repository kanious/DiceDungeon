1. How to build the project

- â˜… Move to the PlugIns/include folder and decompress "boost_1_59_0.zip" file to the "boost_1_59_0" folder. The path should be like "PlugIns/include/boost_1_59_0/boost/...".

- Please set "DiceDungeonClient" project as a starter project and build with x64 configuration / Debug mode. Or you can execute with "DiceDungeonClient.exe" file in x64\Debug folder.
* Release mode is not working because of the library file of Thrift (libthrift.lib).

- If you want to access to the Leaderboard server, execute "x64\Debug\LeaderboardServer.exe" and Press "Connect" button in the right side of UI.
